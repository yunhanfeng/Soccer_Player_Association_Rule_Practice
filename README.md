# Soccer_Player_Association_Rule_Practice
Using the Europe Soccer Dataset from Kaggle, I practice how to use association rule for player suggestion for A.S. Roma

Association rule is usually used as basket analysis. This time I decided to practice associaton rule for sport analytics.
The project is not very well-organized, but it showcases my result of pracitce AR Rule.

I used the dataset from Kaggle ['European Soccer Database'](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer). It is a sqlite file. I dump the data out and write into [CSV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zabPpEDmKZOT5zn_GJbp3fWjv_BEwosX/view?usp=sharing)

In the practice, I use datatable of match and player. Picture my clients is A.S. Roma, and with my analyses, give recommendation of player arrangement.

I conduct some simple exploratary data analysis and further I focus on the home and away matches and winning and losing games. I recommend further what kind of combination of players with higher winning rate.
